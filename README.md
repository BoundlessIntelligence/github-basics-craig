This repository shows basic GitHub concepts, including repository setup, Python coding, and collaboration workflows.

1. Git is a version control system used to track changes in pretty much files , while GitHub is a platform or site that hosts Git repositories online and also adds collaboration features. Kind of like Roblox Studio.

2. In GitHub terminology. A repository is a storage space for all of your project files and version history. It contains:
     - Code files
     - Commit history
     - README or simply just documentation files

3. Forking creates a personal copy of a repository on GitHub, while clonging only create sa local copy on your machine specifically. Forking is used normally for contributing to someone else's project, while clonging is used for singular local development.

4. Create a branch -> Make changes -> Commit changes -> Push to GitHub -> Open a pull request -> Merge into the main branch.

5. A pull request allows collaborators to review, discuss, and also merge recent changes into the main codebase.

6. Issues contribute to project management because.
     - Issues are used to:
         1. Can track bugs
         2. Plans features
         3. Organizes tasks
      
7. Commit messages describe the changes made, ensuring just clarity and traceability. For example `Add loop to print "Hello, World!" Something like that.

8. Branches can allow two or more operations work without affecting the main codebase. They are ideal for testing features or just fixing bugs.

9. A README provides an overview of the project, including things like:
      1. A purpose
      2. Installation instruction
      3. Usage guidelines

10. Three ways you can engage with the GitHub community is by:
      - Contributing to open-source projects doesn't matter what it is
      - Participating in discussions
      - Or reporting or fixing issues
